# Memory Game

## Proposal

This memory game will be a simple card memorization game.
The user will be given a set number of cards in which they will
be hidden until the user clicks a card. When a card is 
clicked it will reveal a picture for a brief moment. 
The user must find and match pairs of the same picture. 
The game is over when all pairs of pictures are revealed.

The game will contain:

* Database of players
* Database of player high scores
* Game difficulty

I'm choosing to make this memory game because I remember playing 
it when I was a kid and it was fun. Also, it seems like it could be challenging 
to make the user interface.
